A User Story describes one thing a program is expected to do, from the perspective of somebody using that program.

Here, we are outlining the Objects and Messages based on the two user stories below

> As a person,
> So that I can use a bike,
> I'd like a docking station to release a bike

> As a person,
> So that I can use a good bike,
> I'd like to see if a bike is working

| Objects | Messages |
|---------|----------|
| User (person) | use_bike |
| Bike | is_working |
| Docking Station | release_bike |
